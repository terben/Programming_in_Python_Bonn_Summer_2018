# Homework solutions for week 6

This directory contains solutions for the homework tasks of week 6. The script
`integral_group_0_plot.py` *should reproduce* the plots for the first
exercise. As I discussed in class, the default settings of `matplotlib`
change frequently with new versions and hence the plots *very likely* do not look
*exactly as* shown on the sheet.
