    "- You will get one project approximately every other week.\n",
    "- Besides the homework-assignmentts, you need to solve the projects in order to pass the course. Your final course mark consists of the marks of four projects. We aim to hand-out six projects during the term and we do not consider the worst project marks if you hand in more than four projects. **HOWEVER: You must solve and hand in the final project (advanced science project analysis). This project will be part of your mark in any case!** \n",
    "- This project requires you to modify and to extend existing source files from your last prohect. If you are done, please collect the files `word_game_level_2.py`, `word_module_level_2.py` and `test_word_module_level_2.py` in a `tar`-file with the name `Your_Name_project_3.tgz`. Please also put your name at the beginning of the source files!\n",
    "- **In contrast to the homework exercises, each student must hand in an own solution for the projects! Of course you can and should discuss problems with each other! However, you must not use code or code-parts from your student peers in your project solutions!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Aakash and I are very happy to help you out with difficulties you might have with the project tasks! You can ask questions any time but please do so well in advance of the deadlines!**"

    "### Part 3: A quicker computer player\n",
    "You see that playing a hand with 10 letters takes the computer player about 10 seconds (for my computer and my implementation). You wonder, whether you cannot optimise this. Our current strategy contains an arbitrary hand and we scan *the complete word-list* whether a word from the list can be formed from the letters in the hand. We realise that there needs to be some better way. For instance, we notice that with 5 letters in hand, we only can form words having five letters or less. Usng this and some other ideas/observations, we now want to optimise our computer player for speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to write a function `choose_word_fast(hand, rearrange_dict)` (depending on your implementation, the function might have further arguments!). It should be based on the following approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we preprocess our word list again, before the game begins. We create a dictionary `d` as in the following pseudo-code:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   let d = {}\n",
    "   for every word w in word_list:\n",
    "       let d[(string containing the letters of w in sorted order)] = w\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "After this preprocessing step, you have a dictionary where, for any set of letters, you can determine if\n",
    "there is some acceptable word that is a rearrangement of those letters. You should put the pre-processing code into a separate function called `word_rearrangements`, analagous to `words_to_points` (within `word_module_level_2.py`).\n",
    "I show in a cell below, how you can obtain a sorted-order of the letters from a string.\n",
    "2. Now, given a hand, here's how to use the dictionary `d` from (1.) to find a word that can be made from that hand:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   To find some word that can be made out of the letters in hand:\n",
    "       For each subset S of the letters of hand:\n",
    "           let w = (string containing the letters of S in sorted order)\n",
    "           if w in d: d[w] can be formed\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   I make available to you a function `string_sub_multisets` (see below) that you can use to form the necessary subsets of the letters in a hand.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Note:** The sets that we talk about here are actually *sub-multisets*, not *subsets* in the mathematical sense! In a formal definition, *sets* cannot contain repeated elements, while multisets, like groups of letters within a hand, can.\n",
    "3. Write the function `choose_word_fast(hand, rearrange_dict)` as described above. As `choose_word(hand, word_points)`, it should return a word for the computer player using the strategy of your choice.\n",
    "4. Modify `play_hand` to use `choose_word_fast(hand, rearrange_dict)` instead of `choose_word(hand, word_points)`. Probably, you need to modify other code parts as well because of the new data structure `rearrange_dict`.\n",
    "5. Play some games and compare the execution times of both computer-player implementations. Charcterize the time complexity of `choose_word` and `choose_word_fast` in terms of the size of the word list and the number of letters in hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:**\n",
    "We saw above that with `choose_word` on my computer, playing *a single* hand lasted about 9 seconds. With `choose_word_fast`, the computer plays 100 hands in below 0.2 seconds!\n",
    "\n",
    "This should show you again, how important a good representation of data is for the execution time of your programs!"
