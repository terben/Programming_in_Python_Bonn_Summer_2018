    "- Please discuss the problems with your student peers in case of problems.\n",
    "- Please send your solutions via mail to Joseph.\n",
    "  - He will correct them and give you feedback on your solutions. I also will talk about common problems in later classes.\n",
    "  - You can hand in Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.\n",
    "  - If you hand in scripts, please use the proposed names to make live easier for Joseph!\n",
