    "- You only learn a programming language by actively praticing and using it! I therefore **strongly** advise you to work on the homework problems.\n",
    "- You are required to hand in group solutions (three students per group) - Please put the names of the students involved and the group number clearly within the Jupyter notebooks or as comments within scripts.\n",
    "- You need to reach 50 % of all possible homework points at the end of the term as one condition for your credit-points.\n",
    "- Please discuss the problems with your student peers in case of problems.\n",
    "- Please send your solutions via mail to Aakash and myself. Collect all your notebooks/scripts in **a single** Unix-gzipped Unix-tarfile with the name `group_X_submission_Week_Y.tgz` (`X` being your group number and `Y` the week-number of the homework sheet) that you send us. Please **do not** send us several individual files for your homework submission but **only one** tar-file!\n",
    "  - Aakash will correct them and give you feedback on your solutions. I also will talk about common problems in later classes.\n",
    "  - You can hand in Jupyter notebooks (please only **one** with solutions for all homework tasks) or Python scripts.\n",
    "  - If you hand in scripts, please use the proposed names to make live easier for us!\n",
    "  - Your code needs to be well and appropriately commented! \n",
    "  - Please note within your script or notebook, how much time you needed for the task. We want to get a better feeling on the work-load we ask for."

    "## Dance of the moons: Janus and Epimetheus\n",
    "Epimetheus and Janus are moons that orbit the planet Saturn; see also [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon). Epimetheus's orbit is *co-orbital with that of Janus*, i.e. they orbit Saturn on nearly equal trajectories. Janus's mean orbital radius from Saturn is only 50 km less than that of Epimetheus, a distance smaller than either moon's mean radius. All four years, the two moons come close to each other as, according to Kepler's law, the inner moon moves a bit faster than the outer one. Your task is to investigate why there is no collision between the two moons.\n",

    "Please have a closer look at the animations of [particles in a box](01_animations_with_matplotlib.ipynb/#particles_in_box) that we studied in class. We only considered interactions of the particles with the box boundaries but not collissions between the particles. If we include this aspect, we can simulate and investigate properties of an ideal gas. Its macroscopic propterties such as temperatures are determined entirely by elastic collisions of microscopic particles; see also [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases).\n",
