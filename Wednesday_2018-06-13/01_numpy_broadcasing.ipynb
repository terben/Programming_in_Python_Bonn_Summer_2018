    "- To determine if two shapes are compatible, `numpy` compares their dimensions, starting with the trailing ones and working its way backwards. If two dimensions are equal, or if one of them equals 1, the comparison continues. If one of the dimensions in this case is 1 and the other is larger than 1, the smaller array is stretched *naturally* to match the bigger one. Otherwise, you'll see a ValueError raised (saying something like \"operands could not be broadcast together with shapes ...\").\n",
