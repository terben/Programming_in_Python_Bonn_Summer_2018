Typical broad-band filters are $B$ (blue; around $450$ nm), $R$ (red; around 650 nm) and $I$ (infrared; around 800 nm). One of the more difficult tasks during processing of optical data is to calibrate the brightness (or the magnitudes) of astronomical data. It is usually easire to calibrate some bands than others.\n",

The blue points are the data and the red points model predictions for the colours. We note that there is a difference between model and data that primarily originates from calibration errors in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the $R$-band has a good calibration and the errors originate from problems in the $B$ and $I$ bands. If we apply *optimal shifts* (defined below) to the $B$ and $I$ magnitudes, we obtain the right panel of the figure below.\n",
